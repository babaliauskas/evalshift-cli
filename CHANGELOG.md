## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- `evalshift init --ci` now scaffolds a production-shaped GitHub Actions
  workflow instead of a single-suite example: dynamic suite discovery under
  `.evalshift/suites/` (a project with no suites yet skips green), one matrix
  job per suite, a single `evalshift gate` join check for branch protection,
  `fail-on: policy` (the action's real default), `evalshift-version` pinned to
  the scaffolding CLI, a provider API key matching `--provider`, PR-only
  run cancellation so base-branch baselines survive, and the full setup
  checklist documented in the generated file's header.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-28

Initial public release.
