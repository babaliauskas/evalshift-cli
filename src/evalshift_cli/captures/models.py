"""Pydantic models for capture files and promoted golden cases.

A *capture* is the JSON envelope the ``evalshift-sdk`` writes per agent
invocation. We mirror only what the CLI needs to read it back:

* The envelope is **forward-compatible** (``extra='ignore'``): future SDK
  releases may add envelope keys, and an older CLI should still read the
  fields it knows. Version gating happens in the reader, not here.
* The inner ``trace`` reuses the strict :class:`~evalshift_cli.traces.models.AgentTrace`
  unchanged — the whole point of the SDK contract is that a capture's trace
  is already a CLI-valid ``AgentTrace``.

A *promoted case* (:class:`PromotedCase`) is the canonical, auditable artifact
``capture promote`` writes to ``<base>/suites/<suite>/<name>.json``. It wraps a
:class:`~evalshift_cli.suite.models.SuiteExample` with provenance the strict
``SuiteExample`` can't carry inline (``extra='forbid'``).
