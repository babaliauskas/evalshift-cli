"""Shared suite-path resolution and the managed ``suites:`` region.

The default golden-suite filename and the ``--suite`` / ``--suite-name``
resolution logic live here so every command that loads a suite (``run``,
``all``, ``bundle``, ``validate``, ``push``) shares one implementation and one
error type.

The same module owns the marker-delimited ``suites:`` region that ``init``
scaffolds and ``capture sync`` rewrites: its markers, its YAML rendering, its
parsing, and the derivation of a suite's evaluator block from what that suite's
captures actually contain. Writer and rewriter agree because they are one
