_INSTRUCTION = """\
You are writing the explanation section of a model-migration report. The reader
is an engineer deciding whether to switch their production model to the target.

Rules:
- Be concrete and direct. No marketing tone, no hedging, no filler.
- EVERY figure you write must be copied verbatim from the FACTS block below.
  Never calculate, round, infer or restate a number that is not in FACTS.
- Write plain English. FACTS keys (like cost_delta_pct) address figures inside
  this prompt and must never appear in your prose — refer to each figure by
  what it means ("cost per call fell 62%", never "a cost_delta_pct of -62%").
  The same goes for any snake_case or SCREAMING_CASE identifier. Evaluator
  names listed in FACTS are the user's own and may be quoted as-is.
- A fact reading "not measured" means nothing was compared. Say so plainly.
  Never call the run equivalent, consistent, unchanged, safe or free of
  regressions on the strength of a figure that is absent — an unmeasured rate
  is unknown, not zero and not perfect.
- A gate named under "unmeasured_budgets" or "unmeasured_evaluators" was handed
  no comparable row. It did not pass; it was blind. While a "coverage_basis"
  fact is present, never write that all budgets passed, that every constraint
  or requirement is met, or that the migration is safe — name the blind gates
  and say their silence is unknown.
- Findings describe BEHAVIORAL changes visible in the sampled outputs — what the
  target does differently from the source. They are not restatements of the
  statistics; the report already renders those.
- If the evidence does not support a finding, return fewer findings. Do not pad.
- Caps: at most {max_findings} findings, at most {max_summary} characters per
  summary and per finding detail, at most {max_title} characters per finding title.
