"""Locate, load, and validate capture files on disk.

Path contract (frozen at SDK schema ``1.0.0``)::

    <base>/captures/<suite>/<capture_id>.json

``base`` resolves to ``$EVALSHIFT_DIR`` if set, else ``.evalshift`` (CWD
relative) — matching the SDK's ``FileSink`` exactly, so the CLI reads from
wherever the agent process wrote. Promoted cases live under
``<base>/suites/<suite>/``. Toolset sidecars — one content-addressed file per
distinct toolset, shared across every capture and promoted case that used it
— live under ``<base>/toolsets/<hex>.json`` (see :func:`toolset_path`; the
fingerprint itself is :func:`evalshift.captures.toolset.fingerprint_tools`).

Unlike the capture *write* path in the SDK (which fails open — a broken write
is silently dropped), the CLI read path **raises** a structured
:class:`CaptureError`. A user running ``capture promote`` on a corrupt file
wants to be told, not to get a silent no-op.

    Built on :meth:`~evalshift.evaluators.tool_models.ToolSpec.from_dict`, deliberately **not**

    list, and the empty toolset here is a real, fingerprinted, first-class value -- "this agent
    was offered no tools" -- not an absence to reject.

    Accepts the sidecar's wire shape (``{"tools": [...], ...}`` -- see
    ``PER_CALL_TOOLSET_CAPTURE_PLAN.md`` § Wire format) or a bare list, mirroring
    :func:`evalshift.evaluators.tool_loader.load_tools`'s top-level flexibility. Both the SDK's
    ``ToolsetSink`` shape (``{"schema_version", "fingerprint", "tools"}``) and the checked-in
    example suites' hand-authored shape (``{"tools": [...]}``, no ``schema_version`` or
    ``fingerprint`` field) are accepted equally.

    After parsing, the ``tools`` array is re-fingerprinted via
    :func:`~evalshift.captures.toolset.fingerprint_tools` and checked against ``ref`` --
    content-addressing is only an integrity guarantee if the content is actually checked against
    the address that named it, otherwise it is a naming convention a hand-edit (the checked-in
    example sidecars are committed, hand-editable files) can silently violate. ``ref`` is the
    only fingerprint this check treats as authoritative: a sidecar's own embedded
    ``fingerprint`` field (the SDK shape only -- a hand-authored one has none), if present, is
    never read here. Every other part of the system already trusts ``ref`` as this toolset's
    identity -- cache keys, ``capture_toolset_refs``/``promoted_toolset_refs``' refcounting, a
    suite example's own ``toolset_ref`` field -- so it is the one value worth reconciling
    everything else against, and a third, unread value is simpler to ignore than to reconcile.

    Args:
        ref: A ``toolset_ref`` value, e.g. read off a capture's ``ModelCallEvent`` or a
            promoted :class:`~evalshift.suite.models.SuiteExample`. May carry the ``sha256:``
            prefix or not -- see :func:`toolset_path`.
        base: Capture base dir. ``None`` resolves via :func:`capture_base`.
        cache: When given, resolved toolsets are looked up and stored here by ``ref``, so N
            captures/examples sharing a toolset read, parse, AND VERIFY its sidecar at most
            once per cache (typically scoped to one CLI invocation) -- a cache hit returns
            immediately, before any disk I/O, so it is never re-verified either. ``None`` (the
            default) resolves fresh from disk on every call.

    Raises:
