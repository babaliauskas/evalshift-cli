"""Group evaluation records into slices for analysis.

A *slice* is a named subset of suite examples — typically defined by a
tag in ``evalshift.yaml``'s ``slices:`` block. The implicit ``"all"``
slice always exists and contains every example.

The output of :func:`build_slices` is a mapping from slice name to a
list of ``(prompt_id, evaluator_name, kind, example_id, source_score,
target_score, delta)`` tuples that the statistics layer can pair up and
test. ``kind`` is part of the grouping identity: one evaluator can score
several axes — ``tool_selection`` scores conformance against ground truth
*and* divergence from the source — and they are different measurements
against different baselines. Testing them in one comparison averages a
regression against a non-regression, which is the bug this whole change
exists to remove.

A pair an evaluator declined to score has no record, so it cannot be
sliced from ``scores.jsonl``. :func:`build_unmeasured` slices the run's
:class:`EvaluatorCoverage` instead, mapping each unmeasured pair to the
same slices its record would have landed in — which is what keeps the
statistics layer's not-applicable count and its ``insufficient`` verdict
alive now that the rows themselves are gone.
