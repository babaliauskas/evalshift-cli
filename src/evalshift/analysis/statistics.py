"""Statistical analysis of paired source/target scores.

Implements the contract from PDF §5.5 step-by-step:

1. Pair scores per slice; require ``n>=5`` to test, flag ``n<20``.
2. Test normality via Shapiro-Wilk on the deltas; route to a paired
   t-test (normal) or Wilcoxon signed-rank (non-normal).
3. Compute Cohen's d for paired samples (``mean(deltas)/std(deltas)``).
4. Compute a 95% CI on the effect size — analytical for the t-test,
   bootstrap for Wilcoxon.
5. After every comparison in the run is collected, apply the
   Benjamini-Hochberg correction (FDR=0.05) across all p-values to
   control false-discovery in the multi-test setting.
6. Classify severity from the *corrected* p-value + effect size.

Why these choices:

* **Paired tests** because each example is run on both models — the
  measurements are inherently paired and ignoring that throws away
  power.
* **Shapiro-Wilk gate** because the t-test is sensitive to non-normal
  deltas at small N; falling back to Wilcoxon (which only assumes
  symmetric distribution) is the standard MVP-grade safety net.
* **Cohen's d** as the effect size because it's interpretable in units
  of standard deviation and the field has an intuition for it
  (``|d|>0.8`` = "large").
* **Benjamini-Hochberg** instead of Bonferroni because BH controls FDR
  at the same level with substantially more power, especially when
  some comparisons are real (which is exactly the case in a real
  migration eval).
