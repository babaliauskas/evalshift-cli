"""Semantic-similarity evaluator using LLM-provider embeddings.

We treat similarity as a *target preservation* score: source is 1.0 by
definition (it preserves itself), and target gets its cosine similarity
to source. ``delta = target - source`` is then in [-2, 0] and any
negative number indicates drift.

This deliberately doesn't make symmetric "both halves same score" pairs
because that would always produce delta=0 and defeat the regression
detection.
